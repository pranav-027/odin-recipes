    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ripe banana</li>
      <li>1 cup rolled oats (gluten-free if needed)</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>Pinch of cinnamon (optional)</li>
      <li>Oil or butter for greasing the pan</li>
      <li>Fresh fruits, yogurt, or maple syrup for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Make:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a blender or food processor, blend the rolled oats until they reach a
        flour-like consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the ripe banana, eggs, baking powder, vanilla extract, and a pinch
        of cinnamon (if using) to the blender. Blend until the batter is smooth
        and well combined.
      </li>
      <li>Let the batter rest for a few minutes to thicken slightly.</li>
      <li>
        Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease
        it with oil or butter.
      </li>
      <li>Pour small amounts of batter onto the skillet to form pancakes.</li>
      <li>
        Cook for about 2-3 minutes on one side until bubbles form on the
        surface, then flip and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until golden
        brown.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter.</li>
      <li>
        Serve the banana oat pancakes warm, optionally topped with fresh fruits,
        a dollop of yogurt, or a drizzle of maple syrup for added flavor.
      </li>
    </ol>
