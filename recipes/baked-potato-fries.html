    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large russet potatoes, scrubbed and dried</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>Optional: Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Make:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the scrubbed and dried potatoes into even-sized sticks to create
        fries.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, toss the potato sticks with olive oil, paprika, garlic
        powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper until evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the seasoned potato fries in a single layer on the prepared
        baking sheet, ensuring they are not overcrowded.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, flipping the fries
        halfway through the baking time for even cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the fries are golden brown and crispy, remove them from the oven
        and let them cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optionally, garnish with fresh parsley for added flavor and
        presentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the baked potato fries hot as a healthier alternative to
        traditional fried potatoes, perfect as a snack or side dish.
